       <h2>The classification of cheeses</h2>
       <p> <quote>Cheeses are normally classified according to firmness, which varies with a degree of moisture. The moisture content of firm cheeses may be as low as 30%, while that of soft or fresh cheeses may be as high as 80%</quote> </p>

       
        <p>There is a saying about a common rule of “5 fingers” when it comes to putting a cheese platter or charcuterie board together. It mainly encourages party enthusiasts to assemble a variety of textures and flavours. Most cheeses can be classified to one of the four basic categories aged, firm, soft or blue. For a successful variety select at least one from each category. Not only the texture and flavours are important to pay attention to, but also selecting cheeses by the type of milk used: cow, goat sheep, buffalo. This will ensure a range of different flavours on a plate. 
        </p>

        <p>Visual “attire” of the cheeses can also be incorporated together in order to add accent to the cheese board. Nonetheless, I like to keep in mind customer’s taste profiles as a main priority when putting a cheese or charcuterie board together. Not everyone is a cheese lover or simply prefer mild- medium flavoured profiles, therefore, Unless a person is experienced with their preferences, Cheese servers recommend to introduce mind- to full bodied flavours gradually.

        <h2>So, which one is which?</h2>
        <p> Mild gouda or well aged hard cheese like Italian Piave with a fruity flavour without sharpness, is a good start. We can then move to adding element with more flavour and interesting taste profile like semi-firm French Cantal or a Quebec beauty Zacharie Cloutier. It exudes sweet aromas of butter and caramel. Both start off mild and turn more flavourful as you continue to bite into it and go well with medium-bodied red wine. Another mild but soft cheese is a triple creme  Pierre Robert, another French beauty. 
        </p>

        <p>Moving up with the taste ladder is sharp 5-6 years aged cheddar is a classic Canadian attribute. Another cheddar like cheese is a British white/red Leicester- delicate, with crunchy calcium crystals.  
        </p>

        <p>It is difficult to avoid a good Swiss classics like Jura Montagne or Appenzeller medium aged (or whichever one prefers in the tanginess/ profile.
        </p>

        <p> A full flavoured firm aged cheeses like traditional Italian sharp and salty Pecorino (aged sheep’s milk cheese). I personally love sharpens and delicacy of flavour incorporated in Pecorino Sardo produced and inspired in Sardinia.      
        </p>

        <p> For cheese lovers I recommend serving Eppoises de Bourgogne which is a soft cow's milk cheese produced by Jacques Hennart in the village Époisses, France, on a separate station or plate. Doing so will ensure preserved flavours of the other cheeses and little to no taste conflict.
